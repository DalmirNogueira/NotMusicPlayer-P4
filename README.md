# App Design

CRITERIA

Suitability

Clarity

Plan for Creation

Number of Activities

MEETS SPECIFICATIONS

The app’s structure is suitable for a music player app. A similarly structured app which focuses on audiobooks, podcasts, or other audio media is also acceptable.

Each activity is clearly labelled, using a TextView, such that the final purpose of such an activity is easy to understand. For instance, one screen might be labelled ‘song detail screen’ and another might be labelled ‘music library’

App must contain a Payment Activity. Student should find an external library or API that can be used in this situation. In the TextView of that activity, describe the library or API and how it can be used.

Any other Activity that requires an external library or class not yet covered also includes the name of that library or class.

The app contains 3 to 6 activities.

# Layout

CRITERIA

Structure

Labelling

Buttons

Layout Best Practices

MEETS SPECIFICATIONS

The app contains multiple activities, each labelled, which together make a cohesive music app.

Each activity contains a TextView which explains the purpose of the activity.

Each activity contains button(s) which link it to other activities a user should be able to reach from that activity. For instance, a ‘Library’ activity might contain a button to move to the ‘Now Playing’ activity.

The code adheres to all of the following best practices:

Text sizes are defined in sp
Lengths are defined in dp
Padding and margin is used appropriately, such that the views are not crammed up against each other.

# Functionality

CRITERIA

Runtime Errors

OnClickListeners

Intents

MEETS SPECIFICATIONS

The code runs without errors

Each button’s behavior is determined by an OnClickListener in the Java code rather than by the android:onClick attribute in the XML Layout.

Each button properly opens the intended activity using an explicit Intent.

# Code Quality

CRITERIA

Code Formatting

Readability

Naming Conventions

MEETS SPECIFICATIONS


The code is properly formatted:

No unnecessary blank lines
No unused variables or methods
No commented out code
The code also has proper indentation when defining variables and methods.

Code is easily readable such that a fellow programmer can understand the purpose of the app.

All variables, methods, and resource IDs are descriptively named such that another developer reading the code can easily understand their function.
